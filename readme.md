# `env-schema` CLI

The CLI and programmatic wrapper for [`env-schema`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-schema) environment variables validator.

Its purpose is to be used as CLI in a separate build / CI step or being programmatically engaged in your build pipeline.

Provides convenient multiple env files validation to ensure they all conform to the same [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) schema. The actual schema can be either local `.js` or JSON file or URL.
